        <h2>Olongapo, Philippines</h2>
        <img src="images/olongapo.jpeg" width = "400" alt="Brown labradoodle wearing colorful lei">

        <p>Olongapo, officially the City of Olongapo, is a 1st class highly urbanized city in the Central Luzon region</br>
            of the Philippines. Located in the province of Zambales but governed independently from the province, it has</br>
            a population of 260,317 people according to the 2020 census</p>
        <P>I visited Olongapo with my mother and sister in 2000 and met my family on my mom's side for the first time</br>
            Since then I have not been back, but I hope to visit again soon.</P></br>

        <h2>Savannah, Georgia, United States</h2>
        <img src="images/savannah.jpeg" width = "400" alt="Brown labradoodle wearing colorful lei">

        <p>Savannah, a coastal Georgia city, is separated from South Carolina by the Savannah River. Itâ€™s known for manicured</br>
            parks, horse-drawn carriages and antebellum architecture. Its historic district is filled with cobblestoned squares</br>
            and parks such as Forsyth Park shaded by oak trees covered with Spanish moss. At the center of this picturesque</br>
            district is the landmark, Gothic-Revival Cathedral of Saint John the Baptist.</p>
        <p>My dad, sister, and I planned a surprise trip for my mom for her 60th birthday last year. We were a little nervous</br>
            that she wouldn't like the destination, but looking back, I think she would have liked going anywhere as she appreciates</br>
            every effort we put into planning gifts for her.</br>

        <h2>Austin, Texas</h2>
        <img src="images/austin.jpeg" width = "400" alt="Brown labradoodle wearing colorful lei">

        <p>Austin is the state capital of Texas, an inland city bordering the Hill Country region. Home to the University of</br>
            Texas flagship campus, Austin is known for its eclectic live-music scene centered around country, blues and rock.</br>
            Its many parks and lakes are popular for hiking, biking, swimming and boating. South of the city, Formula One's</br>
            Circuit of the Americas raceway has hosted the United States Grand Prix.</p>
        <P>Last summer I had the opportunity to drive down to Austing with my girlfriend to help her move into her place.</br>
            It was important to me to help her move down to Austin because I wanted to make her feel comfortable in her</br>
            transition down there. We broke the trip down there into 3 days and I spent another week and a half down there.</br>
            Whenever I have the chance to travel I always find myself going down there not just because of her but because</br>
            her, but also the great weather and food. I always come back a few pounds heavier thanks to the tacos and BBQ!</P></br></br>
