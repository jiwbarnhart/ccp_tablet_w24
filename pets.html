        <h2>Pets</h2>
        <h2>Hamsters</h2>

        <img src="images/hamster2.jpeg" width = "400" alt="Brown labradoodle wearing colorful lei">

        <p>Hamsters! These were the first pets that both me and my sister had growing up. We each had one hamster.</br>
            We enjoyed watching them in their cage/play place. Drinking their water. eating their food. Running on</br>
            the hamster wheel. It was all great! Every once in a while my parents would let us take them out of their</br>
            cage to play with them. My hamster had white fur with orange blots. My sister's hamster was white with</br>
            brown splotches. &#60 3 </p>
        <P>My favorite memory with the hamsters was taking them out of their cage to play. Of course this was only</br>
            after my sister and I had been good, and under the super vision of my parents.</p></br>

        <h2>Chico</h2>
        <img src="images/chico.jpeg" width = "400" alt="Brown labradoodle wearing colorful lei">

        <p>Chico was my family's pet growing up. We adopted him in 2003 from the Calhoun County Animal Center. </br>
            He was very energetic as a puppy and was well behaved throughout is life. He passed away in 2017, but lives</br>
            forever in our hearts. &#60 3 </p>
        <P>One of my funniest memories with him was when I was walking him in our backyard. At some point he realized</br>
            that he was stronger than me (at the time I was 9 or 10) and that he could pull me around if he wanted.</br>
            He started pulling me and I had to anchor myself by hanging onto a tree with my left hand while holding</br>
            his leash with my right. Somewhere a picture of that moment is floating around, but I'll always remember it!</p></br>

        <h2>Simba</h2>
        <img src="images/simba.jpeg" width = "400" alt="Brown labradoodle wearing colorful lei">

        <p>Simba was the first pet that my sister and brother-in-law had adopted and set the naming trend (Disney characters)</br>
            Up until Simba, I had never liked cats. I think this is because my uncle was attacked by my grandparent's cat</br>
            years ago when I was a kid. He was very energetic as a kitten and loved to bite! When he grew up he became more</br>
            conniving. He would climb onto shelves and counters and tip things over and watch them fall. All entertaining</br>
            until he tips something breakable. However, we loved him all the same &#60 3 </p>
        <P>A fond memory I have with Simba was when I stayed the night over at my sister and brother-in-law's apartment.</br>
            I was sleeping in the living room on a blow-up mattress and Simba began to run around me a few times and then</br>
            stop and bite my feet. At his age, the teeth felt like small needles! He did this several more times before</br>
            going to my sister and brother-in-law's door and meowed until they let him in...at 3 AM</p></br>

        <h2>Nala</h2>
        <img src="images/nala.jpeg" width = "400" alt="Brown labradoodle wearing colorful lei">

        <p>Nala is technically my sister and brother-in-law's dog, but we all consider her a part of the family.</br>
            Much like chico, she was very energetic. One day she injured her knee, and because of it, was not able </br>
            to exercise as much. Because of this, she gained weight and became very inactive. However, my sister </br>
            changed her diet due to side effects of allergy medicine she was taking. She lost weight and now is back to</br>
            he energetic self &#60 3 </p>
        <P>A fond memory of mine is meeting her at the SPCA in Kalamazoo, MI and taking he home. She was very timid</br>
            at the SPCA center. I could tell she was nervous, so I carried her on my lap. Halfway through the ride</br>
            my lap became warm and was getting warmer by the second. I lifted her to realize that she had peed on</br>
            my lap! We are on good terms now and she gets friendlier each day.</p></br>

        <h2>Jasmine</h2>
        <img src="images/jasmine.jpeg" width = "400" alt="Brown labradoodle wearing colorful lei">

        <p>Jasmine is also my sister and brother-in-law's dog, but of course is consered part of our family.</br>
            She was just a puppy when they adopted a year after Nala was from the same facility. Jasmine was</br>
            and still is very energetic. To give you an idea of how energetic she is my sister caught her in</br>
            the backyard with the other deer. Instead of running around she was hopping around just like them!</br>
            It amazes me just how energeyic she is &#60 3 </p>
        <p>Jasmine really loves chasing squirels and other vermon. On occasions she has caught them! I like</br>
            to think that in a previous life that she was a hunter. And based on her record I wouldnt't</br>
            doubt if others thought the same thing.</p></br>
